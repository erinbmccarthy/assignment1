<div class="img1"><img src="Untitled-1.svg" alt="1 - Pinpoint Your Mission"></div>
<div class="text1">
<h1>Pinpoint Your Mission</h1>
<p>What qualities, values and experiences are you offering your customers? In order for your branding to seem authentic and be effective, you need to project a truthful image of what your company strives to provide. But before you can do that, it’s important to articulate your company’s mission so that you’re clear on what sets you apart from the pack. Think about the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Why did you start this business?</li>
    <li>What goals do you want to acheive?</li>
    <li>Who are the people you want to help?</li>
    <li>What makes you different from others in your fields in your field?</li></ol></div>
<br>

<div class ="img1"><img src="two.svg" alt= '2 - Decide How You Want To Be Seen'></div>
<div class ="text1">
<h1>Decide how you want to be seen</h1>
<p> Aim for your followers to think of your brand almost like a living, breathing person they can trust. They need to know that you are the one they should turn to when faced with a dozen choices in the grocery aisle or a long list of names in the phone book. Taking your mission into account, decide what type of attitude you want to project. What spin are you going to put on your mission?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Maybe you want to be seen as the ticket to an adventure or a brand new life or a second chance at youth.</li>
    <li>Maybe you want to present your brand as smart and cutting edge. Being seen with your product will make customers feel cool, like they’re in a special club.</li>
    <li>Another approach would be offering your customers a reliable, completely trustworthy option that will never let them down. This is a good approach if you’re selling a product that should never malfunction, like tires, or the white house/government.</li>
    <li>You could also rely on nostalgia to build your brand. People feel connected to things that remind them of childhood and carefree times.</li></ol></div>

<div class ="img1"><img src="three.svg" alt ="3 - Think Like Your Audience"></div>
<div class ="text1"><h1>Think like your target audience</h1>
<p>When you buy a product, why do you buy it? What makes you choose a particular brand? See if you can use your answer to help you figure out how your own brand will come across. Find out what your customers are longing to feel and make your brand help them feel that way. Do they want to feel powerful? Responsible? Conscientious? Smart? Unique? Your brand needs to evoke this feeling with all of its copy, marketing, and design. Cue these feelings.</p></div>

<div class="img1"><img src="four.svg" alt="4 - Refine Your brand Language"></div>
<div class = "text1"><h1>Refine your brand language</h1>
<p>Choose a catchphrase or slogan and some key words that you want to be associated with your brand. The words should be closely aligned with your mission statement, and memorable enough for people to repeat to each other and recognize next time they read them. Use your brand language not only in the copy of your products and advertising, but also when you discuss your business and make contacts in person.</p>
<ol><li>Keep your text as streamlined and basic as you can, because it will be more memorable that way. Two words: ingeniously effective branding.</li>
    <li>All copy associated with your brand, including what appears on your product’s label, on your website, and in advertising materials, should match the tone you’re trying to project. For example, your company is meant to be seen as trustworthy and comfortably old-fashioned, use slightly formal language that will make your customers feel that the people who run your business are as dependable as their third grade teacher.</li></ol>
</div>

<div class ="img1"><img src ="five.svg" alt="5 - Choose a design scheme".</div>
<div class = "text1"><h1>
<h1>Choose a design scheme</h1>
    <p>Your brand needs a look that’s in keeping with the tone of your brand mission and language. Are you modern and sleek? Fun and colorful? Traditional and classic? Totalitarian and strict?This look should be synchronized across all of your media (brochures, website, product, offices, etc.).</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Design a great logo. Your logo will also be used to help embed your brand in your customers mind. When someone sees a check mark, they think Nike, even if there is no other branding. Your logo must be well designed (so hire a professional) and you should use it frequently and place it prominently.
    </li>
    <li>Choose the colors that will represent your brand. These colors will be used as often as possible on promotional materials to help evoke your brand.</li>
    <li>Remember to keep things simple. You want your branding to be easily recognized and quickly remembered. The best way to do this is to be unique but also to be simple.</li>
    <li>You might want to get legal protection for your visual branding and any distinctive phrases you use to describe your business or your offer.</li></ol>
</div>

<div class="img1"><img src ="six.svg" alt = "6 - Involve Your Employees"</div>
<div class="text1">
<h1>Involve your employees</h1>
    <p>Communicate the importance of your brand to your employees and explain why and how you arrived at the brand identity you are promoting. You will need their support for your new branding to be effective.</p>
    <ol><li>Remember that everything your business does is linked to your brand in the eyes of the customer. This includes the way your employees dress and behave.</li>
    <li>Your employees will have their own idea of what your business stands for and whether it is delivering on its promises, and they’ll provide invaluable insights along the way. Ask your employees how they believe your product is being received on the market, and don’t discount their opinions.</li></ol>
</div>

<div class ="img1"><img src = "seven.svg" alt = "7 - Gain Loyalty"></div>
<div class = "text1">
<h1>Gain Loyalty</h1>
<p>If your messaging sounds good but you don’t deliver on your promises, your customers will go elsewhere, and your brand won’t catch on. But if your business delivers what your branding promises, you’ll gain your customers’ trust. Before long, they’ll start spreading the word about your quality of service, and your brand’s reputation will soon speak for itself.</p>
<ol><li>Make sure that your customers’ association with your brand lines up with what you’re actually offering, too. For example, if you promise that your margarita flavored lemonade is the most refreshing drink on the market, but your customers routinely complain that they took a sip and were surprised it didn’t contain tequila, there’s something off about the way you’re pitching the product. You might want to rename the drink so that customers don’t feel let down when they try your product.</li><li>Being transparent about your business practices is essential, too. Trust is a really important part of brand recognition, because of your customer's need to feel like they know your brand like an old friend. Let your customers see how you work, where your money goes, and what your real priorities are. Even if the information isn't always the best, it should at least be true and painted in the best possible light.</li></ol>
<h1>Find Out Who Youre Serving</h1>
    <p>What's the age group and demographic of your main customer base? You might be surprised at the answer, so it’s important to conduct some research to find out who’s interested in the product you’re offering, and how they’re responding to your branding.Maybe it's the 1%, maybe it's Middle America, maybe it's the American People!</p>
    <ol><li>Consider running a focus group so you can test out how your product is received by people from different demographics. Ask them to describe their perception of your product before and after trying it.</li><li>Targeting a specific demographic is often more effective than trying to be universally appealing. You might find that you’ll decide to narrow your focus after learning who’s buying your product. For example, if you find that teenage boys are the most likely group to buy your snack mix, you may want to change your branding strategy to make your product even more appealing to this demographic.</li></ol>
</div>

<div class = "img1"><img src = "eight.svg" alt = "8 - Analysis"></div>
<div class = "text1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>. Conduct research to find out what others are offering and decide how you are different. Your branding should focus on the difference, on what makes your product better than the rest. Finding that special something that sets you apart is essential, because your customers have so many choices that they’ll never even know your product exists unless you help it stand out.</p><ol>
<li>You might find that a certain company has already cornered a particular segment of the market, but that doesn’t mean that your product won’t appeal to a slightly different demographic.</li><li>If you find that the market is saturated with great products, consider pivoting in a different direction. Either change your branding approach or tweak your product.</li></ol>
